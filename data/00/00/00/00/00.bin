  |   Football is all about fun and teamwork. It doesn't matter if you're   |
  |   on the field or play it on console sitting with your friends on the   |
  |   couch. Golazo boldly recalls the glory days of the arcade soccer      |
  |   games, bringing back memories of cult classics we all know. With      |
  |   its vintage, not-too-serious, artistic and creative modern approach   |
  |   to classic gameplay, Golazo is certainly a perfect game for people    |
  |   who are weary of football managers or complicated hard-core           |
  |   simulators. You just grab your pad, sit on the couch and play!        |
